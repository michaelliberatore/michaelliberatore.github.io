SOUNDING TYPOGRAPHY BRIEF <br>
<br> *Supervised by Rick Milovanovic* <br> 

<br>This form of print media is something that I would love to produce more of in the future. Designing record covers for the independent music scene is an area of interest I would love to immerse my creative practice in as a graphic designer. <br>

SOUNDING TYPOGRAPHY BRIEF <br>
<br> *Supervised by Rick Milovanovic* <br>

<br> Baked Beans (now known as Beans Band) are an underground garage psychedelic rock band from Geelong. The bright, messy, and fun quality to my design replicates their sound visually. This was expressed through the loose but playful DIY typography, messy aesthetic, and bright colours. <br>

‘AUSTRALIA WITHOUT THE ARTS IS JUST ULI...IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE’ CAMPAIGN <br>
<br> *Supervised by Alex Margetic* <br>

<br> My campaign is spread across the two distributions of A0 sized risograph posters and A4 sized flyers, with a strong punk aesthetic. This attacks the Federal Government for having no support for the arts, as well as informing the public of the 2020 government arts funding cuts. <br> 

<br> My slogan for my campaign was inspired by the slogan typically seen in street art contexts, 'The Earth without Art is just Eh'. I felt this best encapsulated the expression of the campaign about how important the arts is to Australia's cultural identity, tourism and economy. <br>

‘AUSTRALIA WITHOUT THE ARTS IS JUST ULI...IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE’ CAMPAIGN <br>
<br> *Supervised by Alex Margetic* <br>

<br> I was influenced by designer Jamie Reid’s use of collage design as well as the application of simple bold colours for both of my forms of distribution. Jamie Reid often uses objects, such as ski masks, to obscure politicians/celebrities' faces in his work. I incorporated this into my own work by adding a ski mask over the Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s face. This reinforced the punk aesthetic, while defacing the Prime Minster through my design. <br>

‘AUSTRALIA WITHOUT THE ARTS IS JUST ULI...IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE’ CAMPAIGN <br>
<br> *Supervised by Alex Margetic* <br>

<br> My processes of creating my posters and flyers were through creating my collage on Photoshop and then exporting each design as a Bitmap file. This created the grungy punk aesthetic to my posters, as well as creating the distorted yet still punk in appearance flyer designs. My typeface of choice was Schmalfette, which further provided me with the ability to create and design poster and flyer designs with a strong punk aesthetic. <br>

‘AUSTRALIA WITHOUT THE ARTS IS JUST ULI...IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE’ CAMPAIGN <br>

<br> *Supervised by Alex Margetic* <br>

<br> My intention for distributing my posters and flyers is to display them throughout creative parts of Melbourne (such as the Collingwood arts precinct). This is to show support for affected stakeholders of the issue, as well as providing affected stakeholders with access to my campaign. <br>

MONSTER CHILDREN NEWSPAPER <br>

<br> *Supervised by Dianne Elderton* <br>

<br> My publication is a newspaper of content sourced from 'Monster Children Magazine'. This publication was printed on a low-quality paper stock, to give the publication a newspaper look and feel as well as reinforcing the grungy DIY aesthetic of some of the articles within the publication. <br>

MONSTER CHILDREN NEWSPAPER <br>

MAP OF MELBOURNE ARCHITECTURE <br>

<br> *Supervised by Dianne Elderton* <br>

<br> This print based brief asked for a design of a Melbourne City guide that you would not typically find at a visitor's centre in Melbourne. I chose to design my map on Melbourne's iconic city architecture. All images are my own and information was all sourced online. <br>

MAP OF MELBOURNE ARCHITECTURE <br>

<br> *Supervised by Dianne Elderton* <br>

<br> I designed my city guide with a minimal aesthetic to give attention to both the photography and map. I used a bold typeface as an ode to the depicted architecture. I printed my map on a thicker paper stock, so that the map can be continuously folded and unfolded without it easily tearing. The map folds down to palm size, making it easy for users to carry and use. <br>

SPACE ODYSSEY BOOK COVERS <br>

<br> *Supervised by Dianne Elderton* <br>

<br> The book covers were created for a print project around redesigning book covers from a famous book series. I chose Arthur C. Clarke’s ‘Space Odyssey’ book series. I experimented with cutting images from old National Geographic magazines to produce a surreal sci-fi aesthetic to the book covers to visually communicate the surreal and sci-fi aesthetic of the book. <br>

SPACE ODYSSEY BOOK COVERS <br>

<br> *Supervised by Dianne Elderton* <br>

<br> The book covers were printed on a thick glossy matte paper stock. This gives the book cover weight, so it wouldn’t tear when placed on a physical book. This also gives the artwork a glossy look reinforcing the idea of space and the surreal nature and aesthetic of my designs. <br>

'THE BIG BEAT IN THE HEART OF THE VINYL JUNGLE' <br>

<br> *Supervised by Tristan Ceddia and Rick Milovanovic* <br>

<br> A publication was the most appropriate way to communicate my research and accompanying interviews. I was dealing with and editing a lot of content and information. The publication name was inspired by the slogan of Phantom Records, which was typically found on their side a and side b labels. This slogan was also found on their promotional posters ‘The Big Beat In The Heart Of The Vinyl Jungle’<br>

'THE BIG BEAT IN THE HEART OF THE VINYL JUNGLE' <br>

<br> *Supervised by Tristan Ceddia and Rick Milovanovic* <br>

<br> My publication was concerned with unearthing the nearly forgotten record label 'Phantom Records' and the music that they signed and supported. I undertook this project by conducting secondary research, conducting some interviews, and type setting my own experimental typography. <br>

<br> For the production of my hand stamped lettering I cut out raised letters from thick cardboard material which allowed me to letter press each letter and character in black paint to create a DIY aesthetic to the publication. This helped to reinforce the aesthetic of the record label. I coupled the bold, 'rough around the edges' typography with well set body text in Adobe InDesign. 
<br>

<br> As my content was all about underground music and an independent record label, I wanted to pay a homage to its 'Classic Period' which influenced me to produce my own tangible type-setting process away from the screen. I took the role of a graphic designer, similar to how graphic design was before the digital era.<br>

MAGAZINE FEATURE <br>

<br> My ‘Visions’ graphic was a simple typographic experimentation in Adobe Illustrator, created for fun. This graphic played with the idea of how typography can act as a graphic in its own right. I manipulated and skewed the typography to play around with obscurity and legibility of typography. This resulted in an almost hypnotic and psychedelic look to my graphic. <br>

<br> My ‘Visions’ graphic was later featured in a small print magazine called the ‘Tea and Cake Mag’, which focuses on emerging artists, photographers and designers. This was one of the first times one of my designs was featured and published in a printed magazine. <br>

TYPE SETTING IN DYMO <br>

<br> *Supervised by Tristan Ceddia and Rick Milovanovic* <br>

<br> I created an A2 sized black and white poster which was entirely designed and 'type set' with a Dymo label maker to produce 100 words of ‘type-set’ text. This poster is communicating the limitations and inconsistencies of the Dymo label and label maker, with a strong punk aesthetic. <br>

<br> My poster is also exploring the idea of subcultures in the 1970s that used the Dymo to produce their own art and rebellious designs. These subcultures informally undertook the role as the graphic designer by moving away from only using the Dymo label in a business and domestic context. <br>

DFPR STICKERS <br>

<br> My logo redesign for 'Dead Family Pets Records' has been translated into both digital use for the record label's website and social media, as well as for print purposes. This project was a really exciting opportunity for me as a designer, to use both my typography and layout skills coupled with my strong passion and interest in Melbourne's independent music scene. <br>

LOGO REDESIGN <br>

<br> I redesigned a logo for a small indepedent Melbourne record label called 'Dead Family Pets Records'. The client asked for a clearer and more legibile redesigned logo.

DUNE PEAKS SINGLE ART <br>

<br> The design for 'Eventide and the next light' had 3 accompanying single designs that similar to the EP cover all drew on the soundscapes and sonics of slick drums, bass grooves and washed-out guitar lines sunk in a sea of reverb. I went for a bold, low-fi aesthetic to visually reflect the tone and feel of the single and overall EP. <br>

<br> My design process consisted of photographing a local beach landscape and experimenting with a halftone bitmap image effect and finding a suitable typeface (in this case Schmalfette) that worked well with the cover design & single artwork. <br>

<br> With the single artwork in particular I extracted visual elements from the EP cover to create stand alone single artwork that also connects and links back well to the EP cover. <br>
