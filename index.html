  SOUNDING TYPOGRAPHY BRIEF <br>
  This form of print media is something I would love to produce more of in the future. Designing for the independent music scene is an area of interest I would love to immerse my creative practice in as a designer. <br>

  SOUNDING TYPOHRAPHY BRIEF <br>
  Baked Beans are an underground garage psychedelic rock band from Geelong. My simple yet sloppy quality to my design, replicates their sound visually as expressed through the loose but playful DIY typography, messy aesthetic and bright colours. <br>

  ‘AUSTRALIA WITHOUT THE ARTS IS JUST ULI...IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE’ Campaign <br>
  My campaign is spread across the two distributions of A0 sized posters and A4 sized flyers with a strong punk aesthetic. My campaign is having both an attack on the Federal Government for having no support for the arts, as well as informing the public of the recent government arts funding cuts. <br>
  </div>

  <div class = "item Print">

  ‘AUSTRALIA WITHOUT THE ARTS IS JUST ULI...IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE’ Campaign <br>
  I was influenced by the designer Jamie Reid’s use of both collage design as well as the application of simple bold colours for both of my forms of distribution. Jamie Reid often uses objects such as ski masks to obscure politicians/celebrities faces in his work, which I additionally incorporated into my own work through adding a ski mask over Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s face. Reinforcing the punk aesthetic while defacing the prime minster through my design. <br>

  ‘AUSTRALIA WITHOUT THE ARTS IS JUST ULI...IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE’ Campaign <br>
  My processes of creating my posters and flyers were through creating my collage on Photoshop and then exporting each design as a bitmap file which created the grungy punk aesthetic to my posters as well as creating the distorted yet still punk in appearance flyer designs. My typeface of choice was Schmalfette, which further provided me with the ability to create and design poster and flyer designs with a strong punk aesthetic. <br>

  ‘AUSTRALIA WITHOUT THE ARTS IS JUST ULI...IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE’ Campaign <br>
  My intention for distributing my posters and flyers is to display them throughout creative parts of Melbourne (such as the Collingwood arts precinct) showing support for affected stakeholders of the issue as well as providing affected stakeholders with access to my campaign. <br>

  Monster Children Newspaper <br>
  This publication is a newspaper of content sourced from Monster Children Magazine. This publication was printed on a low-quality paper stock, to give the publication a newspaper look and feel as well as reinforcing the grungy DIY aesthetic of some of the articles within the publication. <br>
  </div>

  <div class = "item Print">
  <img src="assets/images/figure19.jpg">
  Monster Children Newspaper <br>
  I experimented with creating more dynamic compositions with both the sourced body text and headings and in doing so I tried creating a more graphic appeal to both the sourced images and typography. <br>

  Space Odyssey book covers <br>
  The book covers were created for a print project around redesigning book covers from a famous book series. I chose Arthur C Clarke’s ‘Space Odyssey’ book series. I experimented with cutting images from old National Geographic magazines to produce a surreal sci-fi aesthetic to the book covers. <br>
  </div>

  <div class = "item Print">
  <img src="assets/images/figure23.jpg">
  Space Odyssey book covers <br>
  The book covers were printed on a thick glossy matte paper stock to give the book cover a weight so it wouldn’t tear when on a physical book, as well as giving the artwork a glossy look reinforcing the idea space and the surreal nature of my designs. <br>

  Visions Graphic <br>
  This ‘Visions’ graphic was a simple experimentation created for fun playing with the idea of how typography can act as a graphic in its own right. I manipulated and skewed the typography to play around with obscurity and legibility of typography. Producing an almost hypnotic and psychedelic look to my graphic. <br>
  </div>

  <div class = "item Print">
  <img src="assets/images/figure32.jpg">
  Magazine Feature <br>
  My ‘Visions’ graphic was featured in a small print magazine called ‘Tea and cake mag’ which focuses on emerging artists, photographers and designers. This was one of the first times one of my designs was featured in a DIY printed magazine. <br>
  </div>

  <div class = "item Personal">
  <img src="assets/images/figure33.jpg">
  Mental Health Week <br>
 I created this graphic for a voluntary not-for-profit Melbourne based magazine. The graphic was designed in response to an article written about youth mental health, which inspired my thinking to extract words, ideas and quotes from the article and use those words to form an interesting graphic. <br>

  Type Setting in Dymo <br>
  I created an A2 sized black and white poster which was entirely designed, and 'type set' with a Dymo label maker to produce 100 words of ‘type-set’ text. This poster is communicating to the viewer the limitations and inconsistencies of the Dymo label and label maker, with a strong punk aesthetic. Exploring the idea of subcultures in the 70s using the Dymo to produce their own art and rebellious designs, moving away from only using the Dymo label in a domestic context. <br>

  Rodeo Revamp <br>
  This was my first time designing a logo and helping design layouts for jumpers and clothing using my own work, thinking and designs. <br>

  </div>

  <div class = "item Personal">
  <img src="assets/images/figure35.jpg">
  Logo Design <br>
  I designed a logo for a small startup Melbourne based clothing brand called ‘Rodeo Revamp’. The logo is a simple and contemporary logo replicating the simple, yet contemporary and casual clothing made by Rodeo Revamp. <br>
