  PROJECT RATIONALE
  </div>  

  <div class="slide">
  This project is focussing on the narrative of the importance of 'The Beginning, The Middle, and the End' of both films and literature. The three articles are written from the different perspectives of a film editor, a film screenwriter, and finally a summary of what Aristotle's Poetics on what the begging, middle and, end of literature and music means from a philosophical and poetic point of view. My design and layout is influenced from different print media along with the black and white aesthtic of old movies and film. I designed my articles to be interlinked while providing the reader of each article to feel that they are reading a long film roll/script. My 'Not a Book' project hopefully serves as an interesting and unique platform for delivering articles and content to the reader, unlike printed publications or undesigned PDFs. <br>
